            ways to store a secret provided by the .NET Framework.
            But, the use of SecureStrings is not supported in Medium
            Trust Windows Hosting environments. If you are building an
            ASP.NET application that needs to run with Medium Trust,
            set this property to false, and the client will
            not save your AWS Secret Key in a secure string. Changing
            the default to false can result in the Secret Key being
            vulnerable; please use this property judiciously.

            Amazon SimpleDB is a web service for running queries on structured
            data in real time. This service works in close conjunction with Amazon
            Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) and Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud
            (Amazon EC2), collectively providing the ability to store, process
            and query data sets in the cloud. These services are designed to make
            web-scale computing easier and more cost-effective for developers.
            Traditionally, this type of functionality has been accomplished with
            a clustered relational database that requires a sizable upfront
            investment, brings more complexity than is typically needed, and often
            requires a DBA to maintain and administer. In contrast, Amazon SimpleDB
            is easy to use and provides the core functionality of a database -
            real-time lookup and simple querying of structured data without the
            operational complexity.  Amazon SimpleDB requires no schema, automatically
            indexes your data and provides a simple API for storage and access.
            This eliminates the administrative burden of data modeling, index
            maintenance, and performance tuning. Developers gain access to this
            functionality within Amazon's proven computing environment, are able
            to scale instantly, and pay only for what they use.

            <remarks>
            The PutAttributes operation creates or replaces attributes within an item. You specify new attributes
            using a combination of the Attribute.X.Name and Attribute.X.Value parameters. You specify
            the first attribute by the parameters Attribute.0.Name and Attribute.0.Value, the second
            attribute by the parameters Attribute.1.Name and Attribute.1.Value, and so on.
            Attributes are uniquely identified within an item by their name/value combination. For example, a single
            item can have the attributes { "first_name", "first_value" } and { "first_name",
            second_value" }. However, it cannot have two attribute instances where both the Attribute.X.Name and
            Attribute.X.Value are the same.
            Optionally, the requestor can supply the Replace parameter for each individual value. Setting this value
            to true will cause the new attribute value to replace the existing attribute value(s). For example, if an
            item has the attributes { 'a', '1' }, { 'b', '2'} and { 'b', '3' } and the requestor does a
            PutAttributes of { 'b', '4' } with the Replace parameter set to true, the final attributes of the
            item will be { 'a', '1' } and { 'b', '4' }, replacing the previous values of the 'b' attribute
            with the new value.

            The BatchPutAttributes operation creates or replaces attributes within one or more items.
            You specify the item name with the Item.X.ItemName parameter.
            You specify new attributes using a combination of the Item.X.Attribute.Y.Name and Item.X.Attribute.Y.Value parameters.
            You specify the first attribute for the first item by the parameters Item.0.Attribute.0.Name and Item.0.Attribute.0.Value,
            the second attribute for the first item by the parameters Item.0.Attribute.1.Name and Item.0.Attribute.1.Value, and so on.
            Attributes are uniquely identified within an item by their name/value combination. For example, a single
            item can have the attributes { "first_name", "first_value" } and { "first_name",
            second_value" }. However, it cannot have two attribute instances where both the Item.X.Attribute.Y.Name and
            Item.X.Attribute.Y.Value are the same.
            Optionally, the requestor can supply the Replace parameter for each individual value. Setting this value
            to true will cause the new attribute value to replace the existing attribute value(s). For example, if an
            item 'I' has the attributes { 'a', '1' }, { 'b', '2'} and { 'b', '3' } and the requestor does a
            BacthPutAttributes of {'I', 'b', '4' } with the Replace parameter set to true, the final attributes of the
            item will be { 'a', '1' } and { 'b', '4' }, replacing the previous values of the 'b' attribute
            with the new value.

            returned. The system does not return an error as it cannot guarantee the item does not exist on other

             to the Amazon Elastic

             Important - make sure to unmount any

             Failure to unmount file systems, or otherwise
             properly release the device
             from use, can result in
             lost data and

             permissions used to revoke
             must be specified using the same values
             used to grant the

             Permissions are specified by IP
             protocol (TCP, UDP, or ICMP), the source of
             the request (by IP
             range or an Amazon EC2 user-group pair), the

             types (for ICMP).
            
             Permission changes are quickly propagated to instances

            Amazon RDS without modification. Amazon RDS automatically backs up
            your database and maintains the database software that powers your DB
            Instance. Amazon RDS is flexible: you can scale your database
            instance's compute resources and storage capacity to meet your
            application's demand. As with all Amazon Web Services, there are no
            up-front investments, and you pay only for the resources you use.

             Imports the public key from an RSA key pair created with a third-party tool.
             This operation differs from CreateKeyPair as the private key is never
             transferred between the caller and AWS servers.
            
             RSA key pairs are easily created on Microsoft Windows and Linux OS systems using
             the ssh-keygen command line tool provided with the standard OpenSSH
             installation. Standard library support for RSA key pair creation is also available
             for Java, Ruby, Python, and many other programming languages.
            
             The following formats are supported:
             - OpenSSH public key format,
             - Base64 encoded DER format.
             - SSH public key file format as specified in 
             RFC4716.

             Deletes a VPN connection. Use this if you want to delete a VPC and all

             if you believe the tunnel credentials for your VPN connection
             have been compromised.
            
             In that situation, you can delete the VPN connection and create a
             new one that has new keys, without needing to delete
             the VPC or VPN gateway. If you create a new VPN
             connection, you must reconfigure the customer
             gateway using the new configuration information returned
             with the new VPN connection ID.
            
             If you're deleting the VPC and all its associated parts, we
             recommend you detach the VPN gateway from the
             VPC and delete the VPC before deleting the VPN
             connection.

            By default, the AWS Secret Access Key is stored
            in a SecureString (true) - this is one of the secure
            ways to store a secret provided by the .NET Framework.
            But, the use of SecureStrings is not supported in Medium
            Trust Windows Hosting environments. If you are building an
            ASP.NET application that needs to run with Medium Trust,
            set this property to false, and the client will
            not save your AWS Secret Key in a secure string. Changing
            the default to false can result in the Secret Key being
            vulnerable; please use this property judiciously.
            </summary>
            <remarks>Storing the AWS Secret Access Key is not

             <summary>
             Perform multiple PutAttribute operations in a single call. This helps you yield savings in round trips and
             latencies, and enables Amazon SimpleDB to optimize requests, which generally yields better throughput.
            
             Amazon SimpleDB uniquely identifies attributes in an item by their name/value combinations. For example, a
             single item can have the attributes { "first_name", "first_value" } and { "first_name", second_value" }. However,
             it cannot have two attribute instances where both the attribute name and attribute value are the same.
            
             Optionally, you can supply the Replace parameter for each individual attribute. Setting this value to true
             causes the new attribute value to replace the existing attribute value(s) if any exist. Otherwise, it simply
             inserts the attribute values. For example, if an item has the attributes { 'a', '1' }, { 'b', '2'}, and { 'b', '3' }
             and the requestor calls BatchPutAttributes using the attributes { 'b', '4' } with the Replace parameter set to true,
             the final attributes of the item are changed to { 'a', '1' } and { 'b', '4' }. This occurs because the new 'b'
             attribute replaces the old value.
            
             Note: You cannot specify an empty string as an item or attribute name.
            
             The operation succeeds or fails in its entirety. There are no partial puts.
            
             You can execute multiple BatchPutAttributes operations and other operations in parallel. However, large numbers of
             concurrent BatchPutAttributes calls can result in Service Unavailable (503) responses.
            
             This operation is vulnerable to exceeding the maximum URL size.
            
             The following limitations are enforced for this operation:
            
             * 256 attribute name-value pairs per item
             * 1 MB request size
             * 1 billion attributes per domain
             * 10 GB of total user data storage per domain
             * 25 item limit per BatchPutAttributes operation

            The Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) web
            service provides you with
            the ability to execute your applications in
            Amazon's computing environment.
            To use Amazon EC2 you simply:
            1. Create an Amazon Machine Image (AMI) containing all your software,
            including your operating system and associated configuration settings,
            applications, libraries, etc. Think of this as zipping up the contents
            of your hard drive. We provide all the necessary tools to create and
            package your AMI.
            2. Upload this AMI to the Amazon S3 (Amazon Simple
            Storage Service) service. This gives us reliable,
            secure access to your AMI.
            3. Register your AMI with Amazon EC2. This allows us to verify
            that your AMI has been uploaded correctly and to allocate a unique
            identifier for it.
            4. Use this AMI ID and the Amazon EC2 web service
            APIs to run, monitor, and
            terminate as many instances of this AMI as
            required.
            You can also skip the first three steps and choose to launch
            an AMI that is provided by Amazon or shared by another user.
            While instances are running, you are billed for the computing
            and network resources that they consume.

            assigned to another instance, the IP
            address is assigned to the new
            instance. This is an idempotent operation. If you enter
            it more than once, Amazon EC2 does not return an error.

            <remarks>
            The AuthorizeSecurityGroupIngress operation adds
            permissions to a security group.
            Permissions are specified by the IP
            protocol (TCP, UDP or ICMP), the source of
            the request (by IP range
            or an Amazon EC2 user-group pair), the
            source and destination port ranges (for TCP and UDP),
            and the ICMP codes and types (for ICMP).
            When authorizing ICMP, -1 can be used as a wildcard in the
            type and code fields.
            Permission changes are propagated to instances within the
            security group as quickly as possible. However, depending on the
            number of instances, a small
            delay might occur.
            When authorizing a user/group pair permission, GroupName,
            SourceSecurityGroupName and
            SourceSecurityGroupOwnerId must be
            specified. When authorizing a CIDR
            IP permission, GroupName, IpProtocol, FromPort, ToPort and
            CidrIp must be specified. Mixing these two types of parameters is
            not allowed.

            The bundling process creates a new image from a running instance and
            stores the AMI data in S3. Once bundled, the image must be registered in the
            normal way using the RegisterImage API.

            CancelBundleTask operation cancels a pending or
            in-progress bundling task. This is an asynchronous
            call and it make
            take a while for the task to be cancelled.
            If a task is cancelled
            while it is storing items,
            there may be parts of the incomplete AMI
            stored in S3.
            It is up to the caller to clean up these parts from S3.

            The operation returns false if the
            product code is not attached to the

            The ConfirmProductInstance operation can only be executed
            by the owner of the
            AMI. This feature is useful when an AMI owner is

            specified during launch, the instances are launched in the default
            security group. Instances within the same security
            group have unrestricted network access to each other. Instances will
            reject network access attempts from other instances in a different

            The DescribeImages operation returns information
            about AMIs, AKIs, and ARIs
            available to the user. Information returned
            includes image type, product codes,
            architecture, and kernel and RAM
            disk IDs. Images available to the user include
            public images
            available for any user to launch, private images owned
            by the user making the request, and private images
            owned by other users for which the
            user has explicit launch permissions.
            Launch permissions fall into three categories:
            Public:
            The owner of the AMI granted launch permissions for the AMI to the all
            group. All users have launch permissions for these AMIs.
            Explicit:
            The owner of the AMI granted launch permissions to a specific user.
            Implicit:
            A user has implicit launch permissions for all AMIs he or she owns.
            The list of AMIs returned can be modified by specifying AMI IDs, AMI
            owners, or users with launch permissions. If no options are specified,
            Amazon EC2 returns all AMIs for which the user has launch permissions.
            If you specify one or more AMI IDs, only AMIs that have the specified
            IDs are returned. If you specify an invalid AMI ID, a fault is returned.
            If you specify an AMI ID for which you do not have access, it will not
            be included in the returned results.
            If you specify one or more AMI
            owners, only AMIs from the specified
            owners and for which you have
            access are returned. The results can include the
            account IDs of the specified owners, amazon for
            AMIs owned by Amazon or self for AMIs that you own.
            If you specify a list of executable users, only users
            that have launch
            permissions for the AMIs are returned. You can
            specify account IDs
            (if you own
            the AMI(s)), self for AMIs for which
            you own or have explicit
            permissions, or
            all for public AMIs.
            Note:
            Deregistered images are included in the returned results for an
            unspecified
            interval after deregistration.

            <remarks>
            The RegisterImage operation registers an AMI with
            Amazon EC2. Images must be
            registered before they can be launched. For
            more information, see RunInstances.
            Each AMI is associated with an
            unique ID which is provided by the Amazon EC2
            service through the RegisterImage operation.
            During registration, Amazon EC2
            retrieves the specified image manifest from
            Amazon S3 and verifies that the image
            is owned by the user registering the image.
            The image manifest is retrieved once and stored within the Amazon EC2.
            Any modifications to an image in Amazon S3 invalidates this
            registration. If you make changes to an image, deregister the
            previous image and register the new
            image. For more information, see DeregisterImage.

            The ReleaseAddress operation releases an elastic
            IP address associated with your account.
            Note:
            Releasing an IP address
            automatically disassociates it from any instance with
            which it is associated. For more information, see
            DisassociateAddress.
            Important:
            After releasing an elastic IP address, it is released to the IP
            address pool and might no longer be available to your account. Make
            sure to update your DNS records and any servers or devices that
            communicate with the address.
            If you run this operation on an elastic
            IP address that is already released,
            the address might be assigned to
            another account which will cause
            Amazon EC2 to return an error.

            <remarks>
            The RevokeSecurityGroupIngress operation revokes
            permissions from a security
            group. The permissions used to revoke must
            be specified using the same values
            used to grant the permissions.
            Permissions are specified by IP protocol (TCP, UDP, or ICMP), the
            source of the request (by IP range or an Amazon EC2 user-group pair),
            the source and destination port ranges (for TCP and UDP), and the ICMP
            codes and types (for ICMP).
            Permission changes are quickly propagated
            to instances within the security
            group. However, depending on the
            number of instances in the group, a
            small delay is might occur, .
            When revoking a user/group pair permission, GroupName,
            SourceSecurityGroupName
            and SourceSecurityGroupOwnerId must be
            specified. When authorizing a
            CIDR IP permission, GroupName,
            IpProtocol, FromPort, ToPort and CidrIp must be
            specified. Mixing these two types of parameters is not allowed.

            <returns>Run Instances  Response from the service</returns>
            <remarks>
            The RunInstances operation launches a specified
            number of instances.
            If Amazon EC2 cannot launch the minimum number
            AMIs you request, no instances
            launch. If there is insufficient
            capacity to launch the maximum number of AMIs
            you request, Amazon EC2
            launches as many as possible to satisfy the
            requested maximum values.
            Every instance is launched in a security group. If you do not
            specify a security group at launch, the instances start in your
            default security group. For more information on creating security
            groups, see CreateSecurityGroup.
            An optional instance type can be
            specified. For information about
            instance types, see Instance Types.
            You can provide an optional key pair ID for each image in the launch
            request (for more information, see CreateKeyPair). All instances that
            are created from images that use this key pair will have access to the
            associated public key at boot. You can use this key to provide secure
            access to an instance of an image on a per-instance basis. Amazon EC2
            public images use this feature to provide secure access without passwords.
            Important:
            Launching public images without a key pair ID will leave them inaccessible.
            The public key material is made available to the instance at boot
            time by placing it in the openssh_id.pub file on a logical device that is exposed
            to the instance as /dev/sda2 (the ephemeral store). The format of this
            file is suitable for use as an entry within ~/.ssh/authorized_keys (the
            OpenSSH format). This can be done at boot (e.g., as part of rc.local)
            allowing for secure access without passwords.
            Optional user data can be provided in the launch request. All instances that
            collectively comprise the launch request have access to this data
            For more information, see Instance Metadata.
            Note:
            If any of the AMIs have a product code attached for which the user has
            not subscribed, the RunInstances call will fail.
            Important:
            We strongly recommend using
            the 2.6.18 Xen stock kernel with the
            c1.medium and c1.xlarge
            instances. Although the default Amazon EC2 kernels will work, the
            new kernels provide greater stability and performance for these
            instance types. For more information about kernels, see Kernels, RAM
            Disks, and Block Device Mappings.

            Creates a VPC with the CIDR block you specify. The smallest VPC you can create
            uses a /28 netmask (16 IP addresses), and the largest uses a /18 netmask
            (16,384 IP addresses). To help you decide how big to make your VPC, go
            to the topic about creating VPCs  in the Amazon Virtual Private Cloud
            Developer Guide.
            By default, each instance you launch in the VPC has the default DHCP options
            (the standard EC2 host name, no domain name, no DNS server, no NTP server, and
            no NetBIOS server or node type).

            Provides information to AWS about your customer gateway device.
            The customer gateway is the appliance at your end of the VPN connection
            (compared to the VPN gateway, which is the device at the AWS side of the VPN
            connection). AWS might delete any customer gateway that you create with this
            operation if you leave it inactive for an extended period of time (inactive means
            that there's no VPN connection in use with the customer gateway).
            You must provide the Internet-routable IP address of the customer gateway's external
            interface. The IP address must be static and can't be behind a device performing
            network address translation (NAT).
            You must also provide the device's Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) Autonomous
            System Number (ASN). You can use an existing ASN assigned to your network.
            If you don't have an ASN already, you can use a private ASN (in the 64512 - 65534 range).
            For more information about ASNs, go to the Wikipedia article -

            <remarks>
            Creates a subnet in an existing VPC. You can create up to 20 subnets in a VPC.
            If you add more than one subnet to a VPC, they're set up in a star topology with
            a logical router in the middle. If you feel you need more than 20 subnets, you can
            request more by going to http://aws.amazon.com/contact-us/vpc-request/.
            When you create each subnet, you provide the VPC ID and the CIDR block you
            want for the subnet. Once you create a subnet, you can't change its CIDR block.
            The subnet's CIDR block can be the same as the VPC's CIDR block (assuming you
            want only a single subnet in the VPC), or a subset of the VPC's CIDR block.
            If you create more than one subnet in a VPC, the subnets' CIDR blocks must not overlap.
            The smallest subnet (and VPC) you can create uses a /28 netmask (16 IP addresses),
            and the largest uses a /18 netmask (16,384 IP addresses).
            Important -
            AWS reserves both the first four and the last IP address in each subnet's CIDR block.
            They're not available for use.
            AWS might delete any subnet you create with this operation if you leave it inactive
            for an extended period of time (inactive means that there are no running Amazon EC2
            instances in the subnet).

            Deletes a VPN connection. Use this if you want to delete a VPC and
            all its associated components. Another reason to use this operation
            is if you believe the tunnel credentials for your VPN connection have
            been compromised. In that situation, you can delete the VPN connection
            and create a new one that has new keys, without needing to delete the
            VPC or VPN gateway. If you create a new VPN connection, you must
            reconfigure the customer gateway using the new configuration
            information returned with the new VPN connection ID.
            If you're deleting the VPC and all its associated parts, we recommend you
            detach the VPN gateway from the VPC and delete the VPC before deleting
            the VPN connection.

            gateway if you just want to delete and re-create the VPN connection
            between your VPC and data center.
            AWS might delete any VPN gateway if you leave it inactive for an extended period of time

            Creates a new VPN connection between an existing VPN gateway and customer

            The response includes information that you need to configure your customer gateway,
            in XML format. We recommend you use the command line version of this operation
            (ec2-create-vpn-connection), which lets you get the configuration information
            formatted in a friendlier way. For information about the command, go to
            ec2-create-vpn-connection in the Amazon Virtual Private Cloud Command Line Reference.
            Important -
            We strongly recommend you use HTTPS when calling this operation because
            the response contains sensitive cryptographic information for configuring
            your customer gateway.
            If you decide to shut down your VPN connection for any reason and then create a new
            one, you must re-configure your customer gateway with the new information
            returned from this call.

            your own queues. If you provide the name of an existing queue, a new queue isn't
            created and an error isn't returned. Instead, the request succeeds and the queue
            URL for the existing queue is returned. Exception: if you provide a value for
            DefaultVisibilityTimeout that is different from the value for the existing queue,
            you receive an error.

             <summary>
             This class provides some helper methods for creating a Resize Job Flow step
             as part of your job flow. The resize step can be used to automatically
             adjust the composition of your cluster while it is running. For example, if
             you have a large workflow with different compute requirements, you can use
             this step to automatically add a task instance group before your most compute
             intensive step.

            <summary>
            AccessControlList represents an ACL for S3.
            An AccessControlList is represented by an Owner,
            and a List of Grants, where each Grant is a Grantee
            and a Permission.
            <para>
            Each bucket and object in Amazon S3 has an ACL that defines its access control policy.
            When a request is made, Amazon S3 authenticates the request using its standard
            authentication procedure and then checks the ACL to verify the sender was granted access
            to the bucket or object. If the sender is approved, the request proceeds.
            Otherwise, Amazon S3 returns an error.
            </para><para>
            An ACL is a list of grants. A grant consists of one grantee and one permission.
            ACLs only grant permissions; they do not deny them.
            </para><para>
            For convenience, some commonly used Access Control Lists are defined in
            S3CannedACL.
            </para><para>
            Note: Bucket and object ACLs are completely independent; an object does not inherit the ACL
            from its bucket. For example, if you create a bucket and grant write access to another user,
            you will not be able to access the user's objects unless the user explicitly grants access.
            This also applies if you grant anonymous write access to a bucket. Only the user "anonymous"
            will be able to access objects the user created unless permission is explicitly granted to
            the bucket owner.
            </para><para>
            Important: We highly recommend that you do not grant the anonymous group write access to your
            buckets as you will have no control over the objects others can store and their associated charges.

             <remarks>
             Every bucket and object in Amazon S3 has an owner, the user that
             created the bucket or object. The owner of a bucket or object cannot
             be changed. However, if the object is overwritten by another user
             (deleted and rewritten), the new object will have a new owner.
            
             Note: Even the owner is subject to the ACL. For example, if an owner
             does not have Permission.READ access to an object, the owner cannot read
             that object. However, the owner of an object always has write access to the
             access control policy (Permission.WriteAcp) and can change the ACL to
             read the object.

             Deletes a VPN gateway. Use this when you want to delete a VPC and all its

             delete a VPN gateway, you detach it from the VPC and delete the VPN
             connection. Note that you don't need to delete the VPN gateway
             if you just want to delete and re-create the VPN connection between your
             VPC and data center.
            
             AWS might delete any VPN gateway if you leave it inactive for an
             extended period of time (inactive means that there's no VPN

            <para> There are two primary Auto Scaling process types--
            <c>Launch</c> and <c>Terminate</c> . The <c>Launch</c> process creates
            a new Amazon EC2 instance for an Auto Scaling group, and the
            <c>Terminate</c> process removes an existing Amazon EC2 instance.
            </para> <para> The remaining Auto Scaling process types relate to

            all other process types are affected to varying degrees. The following
            descriptions discuss how each process type is affected by a suspension
            of Launch or Terminate. </para> <para> The <c>AlarmNotifications</c>
            process type accepts notifications from Amazon CloudWatch alarms that
            are associated with the Auto Scaling group. If you suspend the
            <c>AlarmNotifications</c> process type, Auto Scaling will not
            automatically execute scaling policies that would be triggered by
            alarms. </para> <para> Although the <c>AlarmNotifications</c> process
            type is not directly affected by a suspension of <c>Launch</c> or
            <c>Terminate</c> ,
            alarm notifications are often used to signal that a change
            in the size of the Auto Scaling group is warranted. If you suspend
            <c>Launch</c> or <c>Terminate</c> , Auto Scaling might not be able to
            implement the alarm's associated policy. </para> <para> The
            <c>AZRebalance</c> process type seeks to maintain a balanced number of
            instances across Availability Zones within a Region. If you remove an
            Availability Zone from your Auto Scaling group or an Availability Zone
            otherwise becomes unhealthy or unavailable, Auto Scaling launches new
            instances in an unaffected Availability Zone before terminating the
            unhealthy or unavailable instances. When the unhealthy Availability
            Zone returns to a healthy state, Auto Scaling automatically
            redistributes the application instances evenly across all of the
            designated Availability Zones. </para> <para><b>IMPORTANT:</b> If you
            call SuspendProcesses on the launch process type, the AZRebalance
            process will neither launch new instances nor terminate existing
            instances. This is because the AZRebalance process terminates existing
            instances only after launching the replacement instances. If you call
            SuspendProcesses on the terminate process type, the AZRebalance
            process can cause your Auto Scaling group to grow up to ten percent
            larger than the maximum size. This is because Auto Scaling allows
            groups to temporarily grow larger than the maximum size during
            rebalancing activities. If Auto Scaling cannot terminate instances,
            your Auto Scaling group could remain up to ten percent larger than the
            maximum size until you resume the terminate process type. </para>
            <para> The <c>HealthCheck</c> process type checks the health of the
            instances. Auto Scaling marks an instance as unhealthy if Amazon EC2
            or Elastic Load Balancing informs Auto Scaling that the instance is
            unhealthy. The <c>HealthCheck</c> process can override the health
            status of an instance that you set with SetInstanceHealth. </para>
            <para> The <c>ReplaceUnhealthy</c> process type terminates instances
            that are marked as unhealthy and subsequently creates new instances to
            replace them. This process calls both of the primary process
            types--first <c>Terminate</c> and then <c>Launch</c> .
            </para> <para><b>IMPORTANT:</b> The HealthCheck process type
            works in conjunction with the ReplaceUnhealthly process type to
            provide health check functionality. If you suspend either Launch or
            Terminate, the ReplaceUnhealthy process type will not function
            properly. </para> <para> The <c>ScheduledActions</c> process type
            performs scheduled actions that you create with
            PutScheduledUpdateGroupAction. Scheduled actions often involve
            launching new instances or terminating existing instances. If you
            suspend either <c>Launch</c> or <c>Terminate</c> , your scheduled
            actions might not function as expected. </para>

             <summary>
             The Select operation returns a set of Attributes for ItemNames that match the select expression. Select is similar to
             the standard SQL SELECT statement. The total size of the response cannot exceed 1 MB in total size. Amazon SimpleDB
             automatically adjusts the number of items returned per page to enforce this limit. For example, even if you ask to
             retrieve 2500 items, but each individual item is 10 kB in size, the system returns 100 items and an appropriate next
             token so you can get the next page of results.
            
             Operations that run longer than 5 seconds return a time-out error response or a partial or empty result set. Partial
             and empty result sets contains a next token which allow you to continue the operation from where it left off.
            
             Responses larger than one megabyte return a partial result set.
            
             Your application should not excessively retry queries that return RequestTimeout errors. If you receive too many
             RequestTimeout errors, reduce the complexity of your query expression.
            
             When designing your application, keep in mind that Amazon SimpleDB does not guarantee how attributes are ordered in
             the returned response.

             <summary>
             Returns information about Amazon EBS snapshots
             available to the user.
             Information returned includes volume ID,
             status, start time, progress, owner ID,
             volume size, and
             description. Snapshots available to the user include public
             snapshots available for any
             user to launch, private snapshots owned
             by the user making the
             request, and private
             snapshots owned by other
             users for which the user granted explicit create
             volume permissions.
            
             The create volume permissions fall into 3 categories:
            
             public
            
             The owner of the snapshot granted create volume permissions
             for the snapshot to the all
             group. All users have create volume
             permissions for these snapshots.
            
             explicit
            
             The owner of the snapshot
             granted create volume permissions to a
             specific user.
            
             implicit
            
             A user has implicit create volume permissions for all snapshots he
             or she owns.
            
             The list of snapshots returned can be modified by specifying
             snapshot IDs, snapshot owners, or users with create volume permissions.
            
             If no options are specified, Amazon EC2 returns all
             snapshots for which the user has
             create volume permissions.
            
             If you specify one or more snapshot IDs, only snapshots that have
             the specified IDs are returned. If you specify an invalid snapshot ID,
             a fault is returned. If you specify a
             snapshot ID for which you do not have access, it will not be included in
             the returned results.
            
             If you specify one or more snapshot owners, only snapshots from the
             specified owners and for which you have access are returned. The
             results can include the AWS Account
             IDs of the specified owners,
             amazon for snapshots owned by Amazon or
             self for snapshots that you own.
            
             If you specify a list of restorable users, only users that
             have create snapshot permissions
             for the snapshots are returned. You
             can specify AWS Account IDs (if
             you own the snapshot(s)), self for
             snapshots for which you own or have explicit
             permissions, or all for public snapshots.

             Windows instances currently support devices xvda through xvdp. Devices
             xvda and xvdb are reserved by the operating system, xvdc is
             assigned to drive C:\, and, depending on the instance type, devices xvdd through
             xvde might be reserved by the instance stores. Any device that is not
             reserved can be attached to an Amazon EBS volume. For a list of
             devices that are reserved by the instance stores, go to the Amazon
             Elastic Compute Cloud Developer Guide.

            Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) offers a reliable, highly scalable hosted queue for storing
            messages as they travel between computers. By using Amazon SQS, developers can simply move data between
            distributed application components performing different tasks, without losing messages or requiring each
            component to be always available.  Amazon SQS works by exposing Amazon's web-scale messaging infrastructure
            as a web service. Any computer on the Internet can add or read messages without any installed software or
            special firewall configurations. Components of applications using Amazon SQS can run independently, and do
            not need to be on the same network, developed with the same technologies, or running at the same time.

            The CreateQueue action creates a new queue, or returns the URL of an existing one.
            When you request CreateQueue, you provide a name for the queue. To successfully create
            a new queue, you must provide a name that is unique within the scope of your own queues.
            If you provide the name of an existing queue, a new queue isn't created and an error
            isn't returned. Instead, the request succeeds and the queue URL for the existing queue is
            returned. Exception: if you provide a value for DefaultVisibilityTimeout that is different
            from the value for the existing queue, you receive an error.

            Retrieves one or more messages from the specified queue.  For each message returned, the response includes
            the message body; MD5 digest of the message body; receipt handle, which is the identifier you must provide
            when deleting the message; and message ID of each message. Messages returned by this action stay in the queue
            until you delete them. However, once a message is returned to a ReceiveMessage request, it is not returned
            on subsequent ReceiveMessage requests for the duration of the VisibilityTimeout. If you do not specify a
            VisibilityTimeout in the request, the overall visibility timeout for the queue is used for the returned messages.

            Amazon S3 is storage for the Internet. It is designed to make web-scale computing easier for developers.
            Amazon S3 provides a simple web services interface that can be used to store and retrieve any amount of data,
            at any time, from anywhere on the web. It gives any developer access to the same highly scalable, reliable,
            fast, inexpensive data storage infrastructure that Amazon uses to run its own global network of web sites.
            The service aims to maximize benefits of scale and to pass those benefits on to developers.

            Changes to the logging status for a bucket are visible in the configuration API immediately, 
            but they take time to actually affect the delivery of log files. For example, if you enable 
            logging for a bucket, some requests made in the following hour might be logged, while others 
            might not. Or, if you change the target bucket for logging from bucket A to bucket B, some 
            logs for the next hour might continue to be delivered to bucket A, while others might be delivered 
            to the new target bucket B. In all cases, the new settings will eventually take effect without any 
            further action on your part.

            Every object stored in Amazon S3 is contained in a bucket. Buckets 
            partition the namespace of objects stored in Amazon S3 at the top level. 
            Within a bucket, you can use any names for your objects, but bucket names 
            must be unique across all of Amazon S3.
            <para>
            Buckets are similar to Internet domain names. Just as Amazon is the only owner 
            of the domain name Amazon.com, only one person or organization can own a bucket 
            within Amazon S3. The similarities between buckets and domain names is not a 
            coincidence - there is a direct mapping between Amazon S3 buckets and subdomains 
            of s3.amazonaws.com. Objects stored in Amazon S3 are addressable using the REST API 
            under the domain bucketname.s3.amazonaws.com. For example, the object homepage.html 
            stored in the Amazon S3 bucket mybucket can be addressed as 
            http://mybucket.s3.amazonaws.com/homepage.html.
            To conform with DNS requirements, the following constraints apply:
            <list type="bullet">
            <item>Bucket names should not contain underscores (_)</item>
            <item>Bucket names should be between 3 and 63 characters long</item>
            <item>Bucket names should not end with a dash</item>
            <item>Bucket names cannot contain two, adjacent periods</item>
            <item>Bucket names cannot contain dashes next to periods
              (e.g., "my-.bucket.com" and "my.-bucket" are invalid)</item>
            <item>Bucket names cannot contain uppercase characters</item>
            </list></para>
            There is no limit to the number of objects that can be stored in a bucket and no 
            variation in performance when using many buckets or just a few. You can store all 
            of your objects in a single bucket or organize them across several buckets.

            Please wrap the response you get from calling GetObject in a using clause.
            This ensures that all underlying IO resources allocated for the response
            are disposed once the response has been processed. This is one way to

             The PutObject operation adds an object to an S3 Bucket.
             The response indicates that the object has been successfully stored.
             Amazon S3 never stores partial objects: if you receive a successful
             response, then you can be confident that the entire object was stored.
            
             To ensure data is not corrupted over the network, use the Content-MD5
             header. When you use the Content-MD5 header, Amazon S3 checks the object
             against the provided MD5 value. If they do not match, Amazon S3 returns an error.
             Additionally, you can calculate the MD5 while putting an object to
             Amazon S3 and compare the returned Etag to the calculated MD5 value.
            
             If an object already exists in a bucket, the new object will overwrite
             it because Amazon S3 stores the last write request. However, Amazon S3
             is a distributed system. If Amazon S3 receives multiple write requests
             for the same object nearly simultaneously, all of the objects might be
             stored, even though only one wins in the end. Amazon S3 does not provide
             object locking; if you need this, make sure to build it into your application
             layer.
            
             If you specify a location constraint when creating a bucket, all objects
             added to the bucket are stored in the bucket's location.

             Changes to the logging status for a bucket are visible in the configuration API immediately,
             but they take time to actually affect the delivery of log files. For example, if you enable
             logging for a bucket, some requests made in the following hour might be logged, while others
             might not. Or, if you change the target bucket for logging from bucket A to bucket B, some
             logs for the next hour might continue to be delivered to bucket A, while others might be delivered
             to the new target bucket B. In all cases, the new settings will eventually take effect without any
             further action on your part.

            <remarks>
            Every object stored in Amazon S3 is contained in a bucket. Buckets
            partition the namespace of objects stored in Amazon S3 at the top level.
            Within a bucket, you can use any names for your objects, but bucket names
            must be unique across all of Amazon S3.
            <para>
            Buckets are similar to Internet domain names. Just as Amazon is the only owner
            of the domain name Amazon.com, only one person or organization can own a bucket
            within Amazon S3. The similarities between buckets and domain names is not a
            coincidence - there is a direct mapping between Amazon S3 buckets and subdomains
            of s3.amazonaws.com. Objects stored in Amazon S3 are addressable using the REST API
            under the domain bucketname.s3.amazonaws.com. For example, the object homepage.html
            stored in the Amazon S3 bucket mybucket can be addressed as
            http://mybucket.s3.amazonaws.com/homepage.html.</para>
            To conform with DNS requirements, the following constraints apply:
            <list type="bullet">
            <item>Bucket names should not contain underscores (_)</item>
            <item>Bucket names should be between 3 and 63 characters long</item>
            <item>Bucket names should not end with a dash</item>
            <item>Bucket names cannot contain two, adjacent periods</item>
            <item>Bucket names cannot contain dashes next to periods
              (e.g., "my-.bucket.com" and "my.-bucket" are invalid)</item>
            <item>Bucket names cannot contain uppercase characters</item>
            </list>
            There is no limit to the number of objects that can be stored in a bucket and no
            variation in performance when using many buckets or just a few. You can store all
            of your objects in a single bucket or organize them across several buckets.

             The PutObject operation adds an object to an S3 Bucket.
             The response indicates that the object has been successfully stored.
             Amazon S3 never stores partial objects: if you receive a successful
             response, then you can be confident that the entire object was stored.
            
             To ensure data is not corrupted over the network, use the Content-MD5
             header. When you use the Content-MD5 header, Amazon S3 checks the object
             against the provided MD5 value. If they do not match, Amazon S3 returns an error.
             Additionally, you can calculate the MD5 while putting an object to
             Amazon S3 and compare the returned Etag to the calculated MD5 value.
            
             If an object already exists in a bucket, the new object will overwrite
             it because Amazon S3 stores the last write request. However, Amazon S3
             is a distributed system. If Amazon S3 receives multiple write requests
             for the same object nearly simultaneously, all of the objects might be
             stored, even though only one wins in the end. Amazon S3 does not provide
             object locking; if you need this, make sure to build it into your application
             layer.
            
             If you specify a location constraint when creating a bucket, all objects
             added to the bucket are stored in the bucket's location.

            returns a maximum of 1000 uploaded parts by default. You can
            restrict the number of parts returned by specifying the 
            MaxParts property on the ListPartsRequest. If your multipart
            upload consists of more parts than allowed in the 
            ListParts response, the response returns a IsTruncated
            field with value true, and a NextPartNumberMarker property. 
            In subsequent ListParts request you can include the 
            PartNumberMarker property and set its value to the
            NextPartNumberMarker property value from the previous response.

             Registers an AMI with Amazon EC2. Images must be
             registered before they
             can be launched. To launch instances, use
             the RunInstances operation.
            
             Each AMI is associated with an unique
             ID which is provided by the Amazon
             EC2 service through the
             RegisterImage operation. During registration,
             Amazon EC2 retrieves
             the specified image manifest from Amazon S3
             and verifies that the
             image is owned by the user registering the image.
            
             The image manifest is retrieved once and stored within the Amazon
             EC2. Any modifications to an image in Amazon S3 invalidates this
             registration. If you make changes to an image, deregister the
             previous image and register
             the new image. To deregister an image,
             use the DeregisterImage
             operation.

            The Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) web
            service provides you with
            the ability to execute your applications in
            Amazon's computing environment.
            To use Amazon EC2 you simply:
            1. Create an Amazon Machine Image (AMI) containing all your software,
            including your operating system and associated configuration settings,
            applications, libraries, etc. Think of this as zipping up the contents
            of your hard drive. We provide all the necessary tools to create and
            package your AMI.
            2. Upload this AMI to the Amazon S3 (Amazon Simple
            Storage Service) service. This gives us reliable,
            secure access to your AMI.
            3. Register your AMI with Amazon EC2. This allows us to verify
            that your AMI has been uploaded correctly and to allocate a unique
            identifier for it.
            4. Use this AMI ID and the Amazon EC2 web service
            APIs to run, monitor, and
            terminate as many instances of this AMI as
            required.
            You can also skip the first three steps and choose to launch
            an AMI that is provided by Amazon or shared by another user.
            While instances are running, you are billed for the computing
            and network resources that they consume.

            <remarks>
            The AuthorizeSecurityGroupIngress operation adds
            permissions to a security group.
            Permissions are specified by the IP
            protocol (TCP, UDP or ICMP), the source of
            the request (by IP range
            or an Amazon EC2 user-group pair), the
            source and destination port ranges (for TCP and UDP),
            and the ICMP codes and types (for ICMP).
            When authorizing ICMP, -1 can be used as a wildcard in the
            type and code fields.
            Permission changes are propagated to instances within the
            security group as quickly as possible. However, depending on the
            number of instances, a small
            delay might occur.
            When authorizing a user/group pair permission, GroupName,
            SourceSecurityGroupName and
            SourceSecurityGroupOwnerId must be
            specified. When authorizing a CIDR
            IP permission, GroupName, IpProtocol, FromPort, ToPort and
            CidrIp must be specified. Mixing these two types of parameters is
            not allowed.

            group have unrestricted network access to each other. Instances will

            <remarks>
            The DescribeImages operation returns information
            about AMIs, AKIs, and ARIs
            available to the user. Information returned
            includes image type, product codes,
            architecture, and kernel and RAM
            disk IDs. Images available to the user include
            public images
            available for any user to launch, private images owned
            by the user making the request, and private images
            owned by other users for which the
            user has explicit launch permissions.
            Launch permissions fall into three categories:
            Public:
            The owner of the AMI granted launch permissions for the AMI to the all
            group. All users have launch permissions for these AMIs.
            Explicit:
            The owner of the AMI granted launch permissions to a specific user.
            Implicit:
            A user has implicit launch permissions for all AMIs he or she owns.
            The list of AMIs returned can be modified by specifying AMI IDs, AMI
            owners, or users with launch permissions. If no options are specified,
            Amazon EC2 returns all AMIs for which the user has launch permissions.
            If you specify one or more AMI IDs, only AMIs that have the specified
            IDs are returned. If you specify an invalid AMI ID, a fault is returned.
            If you specify an AMI ID for which you do not have access, it will not
            be included in the returned results.
            If you specify one or more AMI
            owners, only AMIs from the specified
            owners and for which you have
            access are returned. The results can include the
            account IDs of the specified owners, amazon for
            AMIs owned by Amazon or self for AMIs that you own.
            If you specify a list of executable users, only users
            that have launch
            permissions for the AMIs are returned. You can
            specify account IDs
            (if you own
            the AMI(s)), self for AMIs for which
            you own or have explicit
            permissions, or
            all for public AMIs.
            Note:
            Deregistered images are included in the returned results for an
            unspecified
            interval after deregistration.

            The RegisterImage operation registers an AMI with
            Amazon EC2. Images must be
            registered before they can be launched. For
            more information, see RunInstances.
            Each AMI is associated with an
            unique ID which is provided by the Amazon EC2
            service through the RegisterImage operation.
            During registration, Amazon EC2
            retrieves the specified image manifest from
            Amazon S3 and verifies that the image
            is owned by the user registering the image.
            The image manifest is retrieved once and stored within the Amazon EC2.
            Any modifications to an image in Amazon S3 invalidates this
            registration. If you make changes to an image, deregister the
            previous image and register the new
            image. For more information, see DeregisterImage.

            The ReleaseAddress operation releases an elastic

            Note:
            Releasing an IP address
            automatically disassociates it from any instance with
            which it is associated. For more information, see
            DisassociateAddress.
            Important:
            After releasing an elastic IP address, it is released to the IP
            address pool and might no longer be available to your account. Make
            sure to update your DNS records and any servers or devices that
            communicate with the address.
            If you run this operation on an elastic
            IP address that is already released,
            the address might be assigned to
            another account which will cause
            Amazon EC2 to return an error.

            The RevokeSecurityGroupIngress operation revokes
            permissions from a security
            group. The permissions used to revoke must
            be specified using the same values
            used to grant the permissions.
            Permissions are specified by IP protocol (TCP, UDP, or ICMP), the
            source of the request (by IP range or an Amazon EC2 user-group pair),
            the source and destination port ranges (for TCP and UDP), and the ICMP
            codes and types (for ICMP).
            Permission changes are quickly propagated
            to instances within the security
            group. However, depending on the
            number of instances in the group, a
            small delay is might occur, .
            When revoking a user/group pair permission, GroupName,
            SourceSecurityGroupName
            and SourceSecurityGroupOwnerId must be
            specified. When authorizing a
            CIDR IP permission, GroupName,
            IpProtocol, FromPort, ToPort and CidrIp must be
            specified. Mixing these two types of parameters is not allowed.

            <returns>Run Instances  Response from the service</returns>
            <remarks>
            The RunInstances operation launches a specified
            number of instances.
            If Amazon EC2 cannot launch the minimum number
            AMIs you request, no instances
            launch. If there is insufficient
            capacity to launch the maximum number of AMIs
            you request, Amazon EC2
            launches as many as possible to satisfy the
            requested maximum values.
            Every instance is launched in a security group. If you do not
            specify a security group at launch, the instances start in your
            default security group. For more information on creating security
            groups, see CreateSecurityGroup.
            An optional instance type can be
            specified. For information about
            instance types, see Instance Types.
            You can provide an optional key pair ID for each image in the launch
            request (for more information, see CreateKeyPair). All instances that
            are created from images that use this key pair will have access to the
            associated public key at boot. You can use this key to provide secure
            access to an instance of an image on a per-instance basis. Amazon EC2
            public images use this feature to provide secure access without passwords.
            Important:
            Launching public images without a key pair ID will leave them inaccessible.
            The public key material is made available to the instance at boot
            time by placing it in the openssh_id.pub file on a logical device that is exposed
            to the instance as /dev/sda2 (the ephemeral store). The format of this
            file is suitable for use as an entry within ~/.ssh/authorized_keys (the
            OpenSSH format). This can be done at boot (e.g., as part of rc.local)
            allowing for secure access without passwords.
            Optional user data can be provided in the launch request. All instances that
            collectively comprise the launch request have access to this data
            For more information, see Instance Metadata.
            Note:
            If any of the AMIs have a product code attached for which the user has
            not subscribed, the RunInstances call will fail.
            Important:
            We strongly recommend using
            the 2.6.18 Xen stock kernel with the
            c1.medium and c1.xlarge
            instances. Although the default Amazon EC2 kernels will work, the
            new kernels provide greater stability and performance for these
            instance types. For more information about kernels, see Kernels, RAM
            Disks, and Block Device Mappings.

            Important -
            We strongly recommend you use HTTPS when calling this operation because the

            You can filter the results to return information only about VPN connections
            that match criteria you specify. For example, you could ask to get information
            about a particular VPN connection (or all) only if the VPN's state is pending

            pending or available). The result includes information for a particular
            VPN connection only if the VPN connection matches all your filters.
            If there's no match, no special message is returned; the response is

            (compared to the VPN gateway, which is the device at the AWS side of the VPN
            connection). AWS might delete any customer gateway that you create with this
            operation if you leave it inactive for an extended period of time (inactive means
            that there's no VPN connection in use with the customer gateway).
            You must provide the Internet-routable IP address of the customer gateway's external
            interface. The IP address must be static and can't be behind a device performing
            network address translation (NAT).
            You must also provide the device's Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) Autonomous
            System Number (ASN). You can use an existing ASN assigned to your network.
            If you don't have an ASN already, you can use a private ASN (in the 64512 - 65534 range).
            For more information about ASNs, go to the Wikipedia article -
            http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomous_system_%28Internet%29.

            Associates a set of DHCP options (that you've previously created) with the specified VPC.
            Or, associates the default DHCP options with the VPC. The default set consists of the standard
            EC2 host name, no domain name, no DNS server, no NTP server, and no NetBIOS server or node type.
            After you associate the options with the VPC, any existing instances and all new instances
            that you launch in that VPC use the options. For more information about the supported DHCP
            options and using them with Amazon VPC, go to Using DHCP Options in the Amazon Virtual

            <remarks>
            Creates a subnet in an existing VPC. You can create up to 20 subnets in a VPC.
            If you add more than one subnet to a VPC, they're set up in a star topology with
            a logical router in the middle. If you feel you need more than 20 subnets, you can
            request more by going to http://aws.amazon.com/contact-us/vpc-request/.
            When you create each subnet, you provide the VPC ID and the CIDR block you
            want for the subnet. Once you create a subnet, you can't change its CIDR block.
            The subnet's CIDR block can be the same as the VPC's CIDR block (assuming you
            want only a single subnet in the VPC), or a subset of the VPC's CIDR block.
            If you create more than one subnet in a VPC, the subnets' CIDR blocks must not overlap.
            The smallest subnet (and VPC) you can create uses a /28 netmask (16 IP addresses),
            and the largest uses a /18 netmask (16,384 IP addresses).
            Important -
            AWS reserves both the first four and the last IP address in each subnet's CIDR block.
            They're not available for use.
            AWS might delete any subnet you create with this operation if you leave it inactive
            for an extended period of time (inactive means that there are no running Amazon EC2
            instances in the subnet).

            Deletes a VPN connection. Use this if you want to delete a VPC and
            all its associated components. Another reason to use this operation
            is if you believe the tunnel credentials for your VPN connection have
            been compromised. In that situation, you can delete the VPN connection
            and create a new one that has new keys, without needing to delete the
            VPC or VPN gateway. If you create a new VPN connection, you must
            reconfigure the customer gateway using the new configuration
            information returned with the new VPN connection ID.
            If you're deleting the VPC and all its associated parts, we recommend you
            detach the VPN gateway from the VPC and delete the VPC before deleting
            the VPN connection.

            that before you delete a VPN gateway, you detach it from the VPC and
            delete the VPN connection. Note that you don't need to delete the VPN
            gateway if you just want to delete and re-create the VPN connection
            between your VPC and data center.
            AWS might delete any VPN gateway if you leave it inactive for an extended period of time
            (inactive means that there's no VPN connection in use with the VPN gateway).

            Creates a new VPN connection between an existing VPN gateway and customer

            The response includes information that you need to configure your customer gateway,
            in XML format. We recommend you use the command line version of this operation
            (ec2-create-vpn-connection), which lets you get the configuration information
            formatted in a friendlier way. For information about the command, go to
            ec2-create-vpn-connection in the Amazon Virtual Private Cloud Command Line Reference.
            Important -
            We strongly recommend you use HTTPS when calling this operation because
            the response contains sensitive cryptographic information for configuring
            your customer gateway.
            If you decide to shut down your VPN connection for any reason and then create a new
            one, you must re-configure your customer gateway with the new information
            returned from this call.

            <para> Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) is a web
            service that makes it easier to set up, operate, and scale a
            relational database in the cloud. It provides cost-efficient,
            resizable capacity for an industry-standard relational database and
            manages common database administration tasks, freeing up developers to
            focus on what makes their applications and businesses unique. </para>
            <para> Amazon RDS gives you access to the capabilities of a familiar
            MySQL database server. This means the code, applications, and tools
            you already use today with your existing MySQL databases work with
            Amazon RDS without modification. Amazon RDS automatically backs up
            your database and maintains the database software that powers your DB
            Instance. Amazon RDS is flexible: you can scale your database
            instance's compute resources and storage capacity to meet your
            application's demand. As with all Amazon Web Services, there are no
            up-front investments, and you pay only for the resources you use.

             Gives you information about your VPCs. You can filter the results to
             return information only about VPCs that match criteria you specify.
            
             For example, you could ask to get information about a particular VPC
             or VPCs (or all your VPCs) only if the VPC's state is available.
            
             You can specify multiple filters (e.g., the VPC uses one of several
             sets of DHCP options, and the VPC's state is available).
            
             The result includes information for a particular VPC only if the VPC matches all your filters.
            
             If there's no match, no special message is returned; the response is simply empty.
            
             The information returned consists of:
             a) The VPC ID.
             b) The CIDR block
             you've assigned to the VPC.

            ways to store a secret provided by the .NET Framework.
            But, the use of SecureStrings is not supported in Medium
            Trust Windows Hosting environments. If you are building an
            ASP.NET application that needs to run with Medium Trust,
            set this property to false, and the client will
            not save your AWS Secret Key in a secure string. Changing
            the default to false can result in the Secret Key being
            vulnerable; please use this property judiciously.

             <summary>
             Creates a subnet in an existing VPC. You can create up to 20 subnets in a VPC. If
             you add more than one subnet to a VPC, they're set up in a star topology with a
             logical router in the middle. If you feel you need more than 20 subnets, you can
             request more by going to http://aws.amazon.com/contact-us/vpc-request/.
            
             When you create each subnet, you provide the VPC ID and the CIDR block you
             want for the subnet. Once you create a subnet, you can't change its CIDR block.
             The subnet's CIDR block can be the same as the VPC's CIDR block (assuming you
             want only a single subnet in the VPC), or a subset of the VPC's CIDR block. If you
             create more than one subnet in a VPC, the subnets' CIDR blocks must not overlap.
             The smallest subnet (and VPC) you can create uses a /28 netmask (16 IP
             addresses), and the largest uses a /18 netmask (16,384 IP addresses).
            
             *Important*
            
             AWS reserves both the first four and the last IP address in each subnet's CIDR block.
             They're not available for use.
            
             AWS might delete any subnet you create with this operation if you leave it inactive
             for an extended period of time (inactive means that there are no running Amazon
             EC2 instances in the subnet).

             Stops an instance that uses an Amazon EBS volume as its root device.
             Instances that use Amazon EBS volumes as their root devices can be
             quickly stopped and started. When an instance is
             stopped, the compute resources are released and
             you are not billed for hourly instance usage. However,
             your root partition Amazon EBS volume remains,
             continues to persist your data, and you are charged
             for Amazon EBS volume usage. You can restart
             your instance at any time.
            
             Before stopping an instance, make sure it is in a state from
             which it can be restarted. Stopping an instance does not preserve
             data stored in RAM.
            
             Performing this operation on an instance that
             uses an instance store as its
             root device returns
             an error.

             <summary>
             Launches a specified number of instances of an
             AMI for which you have
             permissions.
            
             If Amazon EC2 cannot launch the
             minimum number AMIs you request, no
             instances will be launched. If
             there is insufficient capacity to
             launch the
             maximum number of AMIs
             you request, Amazon EC2 launches the minimum
             number specified for
             each AMI and allocate the remaining available
             instances using round robin.
            
             In the following example, Libby generates a request to
             launch two images (database and web_server):
            
             Libby runs the RunInstances operation to launch database instances
             (min. 10, max. 15) and web_server instances (min. 30, max. 40).
            
             Because there are currently 30 instances available and Libby needs a
             minimum of 40, no instances are launched.
            
             Libby adjusts the number of instances she needs and runs the
             RunInstances operation to launch database
             instances (min. 5, max. 10) and web_server
             instances (min. 20, max. 40).
            
             Amazon EC2 launches the minimum number of instances for each
             AMI (5 database, 20 web_server).
            
             The remaining 5 instances are
             allocated using round robin.
            
             Libby adjusts the number of instances
             she needs and runs the RunInstances
             operation again to launch
             database instances (min. 5, max. 10) and
             web_server instances (min.
             20, max. 40).
            
             Note - every instance is launched in a security group
             (created using the CreateSecurityGroup operation.)
            
             You can provide
             an optional key pair ID for each image in the launch request
             (created using the CreateKeyPair operation). All instances that
             are created from images that use this key pair will have access to
             the associated public key at boot. You can use this key to provide
             secure access to an instance of
             an image on a per-instance basis.
             Amazon EC2 public images use this
             feature to provide secure access
             without passwords.
            
             Important - launching public images without a
             key pair ID will leave them
             inaccessible.
            
             The public key material is
             made available to the instance at boot
             time by placing it in the
             openssh_id.pub file on a logical device that is exposed
             to the instance as /dev/sda2 (the instance store). The format of this
             file is suitable
             for use as an entry within ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
             (the OpenSSH format).
             This can be done at boot (e.g., as part of
             rc.local) allowing for secure access
             without passwords.
            
             Optional user data can be provided in the launch request. All instances that
             collectively comprise the launch request have access to this data.
             For more information, go the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud Developer
             Guide.
            
             Note - if any of the AMIs have a product code attached for
             which the user has not subscribed, the RunInstances call will fail.
            
             Important - we strongly recommend using the 2.6.18 Xen stock
             kernel with High-CPU and High-Memory instances. Although the
             default Amazon EC2
             kernels will work, the new kernels provide
             greater stability and performance
             for these instance types. For more
             information about kernels, go the Amazon
             Elastic Compute Cloud
             Developer Guide

             Returns information about AMIs, AKIs, and ARIs.
             This includes image type, product
             codes, architecture, and kernel
             and RAM disk IDs. Images available to
             you include public images,
             private images that you own, and private images owned by other
             users for which you have explicit launch permissions.
            
             Launch
             permissions fall into three categories:
            
             1. public:
             The owner of the AMI granted launch permissions for the AMI to the
             all group. All users have launch permissions for these AMIs.
            
             explicit:
             The owner of the AMI granted launch permissions to a specific user.
            
             3. implicit:
             A user has implicit launch permissions for all AMIs he or she
             owns.
            
             The list of AMIs returned can be modified by specifying AMI IDs,
             AMI owners, or users with launch permissions. If no options are
             specified, Amazon EC2 returns all AMIs for
             which the user has launch permissions.
            
             If you specify one or more AMI IDs, only AMIs that have the
             specified IDs are returned. If you specify an invalid AMI
             ID, a fault is returned. If you specify an AMI ID for which
             you do not have access, it will not be included in the returned
             results.
            
             If you specify one or more AMI owners, only AMIs from the
             specified owners and for which you have access are returned. The
             results can include the account IDs of the
             specified owners, amazon for AMIs owned by Amazon or self for AMIs that you
             own.
            
             If you specify a list of executable users, only users that have
             launch permissions for the AMIs are returned. You can specify account IDs
             (if you own the AMI(s)), self for AMIs for which you own or have
             explicit permissions, or all for public AMIs.

             Creates a snapshot of an Amazon EBS volume and
             stores it in Amazon S3. You can
             use snapshots for backups, to make
             identical copies of instance
             devices, and to save data before
             shutting down an instance. For more information about
             Amazon EBS, go to the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud Developer Guide.
            
             When taking a snapshot of a file system, we recommend unmounting it
             first. This ensures the file system metadata is in a consistent state,
             that the 'mounted indicator' is cleared, and that all applications
             using that file system are stopped and in a consistent state. Some file
             systems, such as xfs, can freeze and unfreeze activity so a
             snapshot can be made without unmounting.
            
             For Linux/UNIX, enter the
             following command from the command line.
            
             umount -d /dev/sdh
            
             For Windows, open Disk Management, right-click the volume to unmount,
             and select Change Drive Letter and Path. Then, select the mount
             point to remove
             and click Remove.

             Gives you information about your VPN gateways.
             You can filter the results to return information
             only about VPN gateways that match criteria you specify. For example,
             you could ask to get information about a particular VPN gateway (or all) only
             if the gateway's state is pending or available. You can specify
             multiple filters (e.g., the VPN gateway is in a particular
             Availability Zone and the gateway's state is pending or available).
             The result includes information for a particular VPN gateway only if
             the gateway matches all your filters. If there's no match, no
             special message is returned; the response is simply empty.
            
             The returned information consists of:
            
             1. The VPN gateway ID - The current state of the VPN gateway
             (pending, available, deleting, deleted)
             2. The type of VPN connection the VPN gateway supports.
             3. The Availability Zone where the VPN gateway was created.
             4. The VPCs the VPN gateway is attached to and the state of each

             Gives you information about your VPN connections.
            
             Important - we strongly recommend you use HTTPS when calling this
             operation because the response contains sensitive cryptographic
             information for configuring your customer gateway.
            
             You can filter the results to return information only about VPN
             connections that match criteria you specify.
            
             For example, you could ask to get information about a particular VPN
             connection (or all) only if the VPN's state is pending or available.
            
             You can specify multiple filters (e.g., the VPN connection is
             associated with a particular VPN gateway, and
             the gateway's state is pending or available).
            
             The result includes information for a particular VPN connection
             only if the VPN connection matches all your filters.
            
             If there's no match, no special message is returned; the response is
             simply empty.
            
             The returned information consists of:
             1. The VPN connection ID.
             2. The type of connection.
             3. Customer gateway ID.
             4. VPN gateway ID.
             5. The current state of the VPN connection (pending, available,
             deleting, deleted).
             6. The customer gateway configuration information in the
             native XML format.

             <summary>
             Perform multiple DeleteAttributes operations in a single call. This helps you yield savings in round trips and
             latencies, and enables Amazon SimpleDB to optimize requests, which generally yields better throughput.
            
             Amazon SimpleDB uniquely identifies attributes in an item by their name/value combinations. For example, a
             single item can have the attributes { "first_name", "first_value" } and { "first_name", second_value" }. However,
             it cannot have two attribute instances where both the attribute name and attribute value are the same.
            
             Note: You cannot specify an empty string as an item or attribute name.
            
             The operation succeeds or fails in its entirety. There are no partial deletes.
            
             You can execute multiple BatchDeleteAttributes operations and other operations in parallel. However, large numbers of
             concurrent BatchDeleteAttributes calls can result in Service Unavailable (503) responses.
            
             This operation is vulnerable to exceeding the maximum URL size.
            
             The following limitations are enforced for this operation:
            
             * 256 attribute name-value pairs per item
             * 1 MB request size
             * 1 billion attributes per domain
             * 10 GB of total user data storage per domain
             * 25 item limit per BatchDeleteAttributes operation

             Creates a VPC with the CIDR block you specify.
             The smallest VPC you can create uses a /28 netmask (16 IP
             addresses), and the largest uses a /18 netmask (16,384 IP addresses).
             To help you decide how big to make your VPC, go to the
             topic about creating VPCs in the Amazon Virtual Private Cloud
             Developer Guide.
            
             By default, each instance you launch in the VPC has the default DHCP
             options (the standard EC2 host name, no domain name, no DNS server, no NTP
             server, and no NetBIOS server or node type).
            
             AWS might delete any VPC that you create with this operation
             if you leave it inactive for an extended period of time (inactive
             means that there are no running Amazon EC2 instances in the VPC).

             The DeleteQueue action deletes the queue specified by the queue URL, regardless of whether the queue is empty.
             If the specified queue does not exist, SQS returns a successful response. Use DeleteQueue with care; once you
             delete your queue, any messages in the queue are no longer available.
            
             When you delete a queue, the deletion process takes up to 60 seconds. Requests you send involving that queue
             during the 60 seconds might succeed. For example, a SendMessage request might succeed, but after the 60 seconds,
             the queue and that message you sent no longer exist. Also, when you delete a queue, you must wait at least 60 seconds
             before creating a queue with the same name.

            The Select operation returns a set of Attributes for ItemNames that match the select expression.
            The total size of the response cannot exceed 1 MB in total size. Amazon SimpleDB automatically adjusts the number of items
            returned per page to enforce this limit. For example, even if you ask to retrieve 2500 items, but each individual
            item is 10 kB in size, the system returns 100 items and an appropriate next token so you can get the next page of results.
            Operations that run longer than 5 seconds return a time-out error response or a partial or empty result set. Partial
            and empty result sets contains a next token which allow you to continue the operation from where it left off.
            Responses larger than one megabyte return a partial result set.

             Releases an elastic IP address associated with
             your account.
            
             If you run this operation on an elastic IP address
             that is already released,
             the address might be assigned to another
             account which will cause Amazon
             EC2 to return an error.
            
             Note -
             releasing an IP address automatically disassociates it from any
             instance with which it is associated. To disassociate an IP
             address without
             releasing it, use the DisassociateAddress
             operation.
            
             Important - after releasing an elastic IP address, it is
             released to the IP
             address pool and might no longer be available to
             your account. Make sure
             to update your DNS records and any servers
             or devices that communicate with the address.

            Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) offers a reliable, highly scalable hosted queue for storing
            messages as they travel between computers. By using Amazon SQS, developers can simply move data between
            distributed application components performing different tasks, without losing messages or requiring each
            component to be always available.  Amazon SQS works by exposing Amazon's web-scale messaging infrastructure
            as a web service. Any computer on the Internet can add or read messages without any installed software or
            special firewall configurations. Components of applications using Amazon SQS can run independently, and do
            not need to be on the same network, developed with the same technologies, or running at the same time.

            The CreateQueue action creates a new queue, or returns the URL of an existing one.
            When you request CreateQueue, you provide a name for the queue. To successfully create
            a new queue, you must provide a name that is unique within the scope of your own queues.
            If you provide the name of an existing queue, a new queue isn't created and an error
            isn't returned. Instead, the request succeeds and the queue URL for the existing queue is
            returned. Exception: if you provide a value for DefaultVisibilityTimeout that is different
            from the value for the existing queue, you receive an error.

            the message body; MD5 digest of the message body; receipt handle, which is the identifier you must provide
            when deleting the message; and message ID of each message. Messages returned by this action stay in the queue
            until you delete them. However, once a message is returned to a ReceiveMessage request, it is not returned
            on subsequent ReceiveMessage requests for the duration of the VisibilityTimeout. If you do not specify a
            VisibilityTimeout in the request, the overall visibility timeout for the queue is used for the returned messages.

             <summary>
             The PutAttributes operation creates or replaces attributes in an item. Attributes are uniquely identified in an
             item by their name/value combination. For example, a single item can have the attributes { "first_name",
             "first_value" } and { "first_name", second_value" }. However, it cannot have two attribute instances where both
             the attribute name and attribute value are the same.
            
             Optionally, the requestor can supply the Replace parameter for each individual attribute. Setting this value to
             true causes the new attribute value to replace the existing attribute value(s). For example, if an item has the
             attributes { 'a', '1' }, { 'b', '2'} and { 'b', '3' } and the requestor calls PutAttributes using the attributes
             { 'b', '4' } with the Replace parameter set to true, the final attributes of the item are changed to { 'a', '1' }
             and { 'b', '4' }, which replaces the previous values of the 'b' attribute with the new value.
            
             Note: Using PutAttributes to replace attribute values that do not exist will not result in an error response.
            
             You cannot specify an empty string as an attribute name. Because Amazon SimpleDB makes multiple copies of your data
             and uses an eventual consistency update model, an immediate GetAttributes or Select request (read) immediately after a
             DeleteAttributes request (write) might not return the updated data.
            
             The following limitations are enforced for this operation:
            
             * 256 total attribute name-value pairs per item
             * One billion attributes per domain
             * 10 GB of total user data storage per domain
